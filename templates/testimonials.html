              I got the son of Champion Duke from FamilyDog back in 2018. I spoke to Prince,  saw a picture of “Jordan” and took a flight from Mumbai and came to Delhi. Prince has great expertise when it comes to dogs and his industry knowledge is unmatchable. Over the call itself, I felt that this is the guy whom I can rely upon if I want to ever have a puppy. He took the best care of Jordan and shipped him to Mumbai after a few days.

              We got Fluffy from Prince back in 2015 from his Rajouri Garden shop and since then we share a great relationship with him. My sister went to the shop and Prince explained everything that a new owner should be knowing. He has a huge product range to offer and made all the wishes true for a first time Dog owner. I can’t thank him enough.

              I saw a video of Champion American bully “Duke” on Youtube and since that time only I decided that I wanted a puppy from FamilyDog. I spoke to Prince and everything was smooth and genuine. He patiently answered all my queries and supported me to select the color and puppy of my choice and even shipped the puppy to me. Now, Oscar is my lifeline and I got a tattoo too of Oscar.  I am touch with Prince since ever then and I just want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for this amazing boy!!

              Prince is my dear friend. I got both of my dogs from FamilyDog and even suggested to numerous people about the excellent service and knowledge he brings to the table when it comes to dogs. My friend got two Shihtzu and one Pekingese from him, my niece got her Labrador from him, my cousin got his Pitbull from him and a lot of people I know who got their dogs from Prince and FamilyDog. If you want to listen to a highly educated dog lover, breeder, and expert,  you should talk to Prince Gulati!

            A friend recommended FamilyDog when we were so confused about so many different breeds and different prices quoted to me. It was getting hectic before I spoke to Prince Gulati. He explained everything patiently about the type of Dog my family should get being a 1st-time owner. Not only this, we were lucky enough to get his personal dog Rio’s son. I didn’t see any adorable puppy other than that and it was love at first sight. “Bolt” entered my Family and our lives and things have never been the same. Now, I share a different relationship with Prince, and thanking him would be a small word for the bundle of joy he delivered to our lives.

          We got Cooper from FamilyDog back in 2015 from their Rajouri Garden store. I waited for Cooper for almost 2 weeks as advised by  Prince. He informed me everything about the breed and asked me to wait for the best puppy as there was no appropriate puppy available. Cooper is the best Golden Retriever in the whole world and the best thing happened to me and my family. He just rocked our lives without playing a beat!
